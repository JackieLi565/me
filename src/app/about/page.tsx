            So you probably know by now, but for those who don&apos;t my name is
            <span className="text-cyan-600 font-semibold"> Jackie Li</span>. I
            have been learning{" "}
            <span className="text-cyan-600 font-semibold">web development</span>{" "}
            for about a year and I&apos;ve enjoyed every single minute of it.

          It all started during my second year at{" "}
          <TextLogo logo={tmu} size="w-10">
            Toronto Metropolitain University
          </TextLogo>{" "}
          where I took an introduction to{" "}
          <TextLogo logo={java} size="w-3.5">
            Java
          </TextLogo>{" "}
          course. At first, like many, I didn&apos;t enjoy it, but during this
          time I also joined my school&apos;s robotics team{" "}
          <TextLogo logo={tmr} size="rounded">
            Toronto Met Robotics
          </TextLogo>
          . Joining the team gave me a lot of insight into how I could apply
          code to{" "}
          <span className="text-cyan-600 font-semibold">
            real-world applications
          </span>
          , and not just simple Java games. At the time I was tasked with fixing
          some code in an existing{" "}
          <TextLogo logo={react} size="w-3.5">
            React.js
          </TextLogo>{" "}
          project. I&apos;m not going to lie it was really hard at first,
          jumping from Java to JSX syntax, but I truly believe this step was
          where I experienced something refreshing in programming. Fast forward
          a little I started from square one with{" "}
          <TextLogo logo={js} size="w-3.5">
            Javascript
          </TextLogo>{" "}
          where I taught myself the basics via online tutorials, and now I am
          mainly focused on{" "}
          <span className="text-cyan-600 font-semibold">
            continuous development
          </span>{" "}
          on the athletics management system for my school&apos;s recreational
          department.
